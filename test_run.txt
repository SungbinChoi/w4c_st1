# How to make predictions on stage1 heldout testset

1. Prepare test data (R1~R6)
  Download all stage 1 test data files & Move them to '$BASE_DIR/0_data_heldout' folder
    e.g.,  R1.zip should be located in '$BASE_DIR/0_data_heldout/R1/R1.zip'
  Unzip each one of them
    e.g.,  cd $BASE_DIR/0_data_heldout/R1
           unzip R1.zip

2. Run predictions
  cd $BASE_DIR/test
  ./test.sh
  ./combine.sh
  ./zip.sh
  
3. Stage 1 core     task test submission file will be at   $BASE_DIR/test/submit
   Stage 1 transfer task test submission file will be at   $BASE_DIR/test/submit2
